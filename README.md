The pipeline will consist of the following stages:

1. Data Ingestion: Extract raw data from a source (e.g., CSV file, database).
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and performing data normalization.
3. Data Transformation: Apply transformations to the data, such as feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and encoding categorical variables.
4. Data Loading: Load the transformed data into a target system (e.g., database, data warehouse).
